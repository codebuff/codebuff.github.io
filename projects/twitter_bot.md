A Twitter bot built using Gooogle App Script which posts hourly updates about event scheduled in that hour to the official twitter handle.

At the heart was a spreadsheet parser which took a spreadsheet in predefined format, figured out the event scheduled in that hour and then if the text was bigger than 140 characters, split it into multiple tweets and posted to official twitter handle.

Since most people are familiar with spreadsheets, one can give access of spreadsheet to the event coordinator and he/she can modify the file as per the requirements and the bot will take care of the new content.

Please see [screenshots below](#screenshots).

Google App Scripts sheets API and oauth API made it all possible.
