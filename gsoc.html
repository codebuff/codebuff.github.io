                <p>Google Summer of Code is a global program. Students work with
                    an open source organization on
                    a 3 month programming project.</p>
                <p>In GSoc '15, I got an exciting opportunity to contribute in
                    an open source project. My mentor
                    was Mr. Ben Smith(Software Engineer, Google) and
                    organization was Portable Native Client,
                    The Chromium Project(Google Chrome).</p>
                <h5 class="">Project Details</h5>
                <hr/>
                <p>Native Client is a sandbox for running compiled C and C++
                    code in the browser efficiently and
                    securely, independent of the userâ€™s operating system.</p>
                <p>The goal of this project was to port Tor to Native Client
                    Platform.</p>
                <p>In order to achieve this, necessary changes were made in
                    Tor's codebase and any unported
                    dependencies (in case of Tor it was Libevent) so that it can
                    be compiled with Native Client
                    toolchains and can be run in the Chrome browser.</p>
                <p>The compiled C code can be run in Chrome which provides the
                    same functionality as the Tor
                    running in the native OS(viz. linux, windows etc).</p>
                <p>The project was finished successfully and a couple of
                    extended goals were also achieved.</p>
                <p>Later, a Chrome App was also released on webstore, more
                    details about it can be seen <a
